1. Need to make the mapped keyboard key names in config tool better

1. Add the colour + country thing for funky

1. Check Times Flies fix and add lets make a steal fix

2. Add fixed conyard cameo text: http://cnc-comm.com/community/index.php?topic=2282.0

3. Add ants cameos: http://forums.cncnz.com/topic/17482-portablera-beta/page-16#entry212164

4. Add Einstein cameo: http://forums.cncnz.com/topic/17482-portablera-beta/page-16#entry212170

10. Don't forget to change multiplayer name back to "NoName"

11. Units that need cameo icons:
-   C1
-   C2
-   C3
-   C4
-   C5
-   C6
-   C7
-   C8
-   C9
-   C10
-   DELPHI
-   CHAN

13. Need new savegames for fixed missions

14. Upload new campaign.mix file with fixed maps

15. Add a rules.ini setting to allow AI to gain more credits from harvesting, maybe also have them ignore maximum ore sotrage limit?

16. make AI build one service depot, cameo pillbox (hack normal pillbox code) and one nuke silo, service depot count is HouseClass+0x366, nuke silo count is HouseClass+0x37a

17. Make AI not build radar jammer and Mad Tank

18. Need to set credits to display before map and save load to 0 if you have 1.4 billion then start another game the game slowly lowers the displayed credit count of 1.4 billion to the actual amount, check 0x004ACC3E

16. mention fixed time flies mission in features list if the mission is actually fixed

19. 0x0056A95F is growthrate for ore mines, need to modify it is read from the map with its own value instead of using growthrate

20. Probably need to add an option to disable changing alliances for spawner games (after predetermined alliances are run)

16. Update language packs with FunkyFr3sh's versions

17. So seems the vehicle sell logic works so long as the vehicle was not at full health when moving onto the pad. check calls to FootClass::Sell_Back(int)

23 I keep forgetting to mention, not exactly a bug, but the Cargo Truck did not have a shadow until
Aftermath, yet in Aftermath, the fixed SHP with the shadow is inside conquer.mix (and not expand2.mix), so if you play the original
campaign or Counterstrike missions, you still get the old Cargo Truck without the shadow (this is non-issue for the TFD version, I suppose).
Basically, putting the new version of the SHP inside expand2.mix should fix it.

22. Mention all non-code patches in my patch notes.

23. Add different colour remaps for buildings and units
Feb 20 23:39:21 <iran> CCHyper: yeah TechnoClass offset 0x10 has the vftable with value 0x5F73E000 for BuildingClass
red colour remap is 0x00666B3E
NOTE: MCV should have building colour!

21. Check out arda auto adjust on game grid option and check where to find it. It only works in windowed mode under cnc-ddraw and modifies width and height based on something, probably game, need to add launcher logic so this only gets enabled in windowed mode (enable/disable when windowed mode checkbox is changeed and make sure to do a check while saving options)

9. Fix Radar Dome crash.

11. selecting a harvester target ore patch on the radar minimap shows a "can't go there" cursor instead of the attack cursor.

can't move is mousetype 0x11, attack is 16, actiontype move is 1 or 2


Todo for later:
--------------------------------------
18. There's graphical glitching in the no-refresh area of the sidebar with the keybar toggle key in 640x480, need to copy code from options menu to clear buffer. This code might be useful to fix graphical glitching on maps smaller than reso.


9. Update forceAM and forceAMfastbuildspeed rules.ini files to use updated oos-fix.ini to prevent issues with barrels in single player etc

10. Add option to not have ai build mad tanks

11. Add option to not have ai build demo trucks

12. Add option to not have ai build radar jammer

12. Add "Unable to build more" sound when tank limit is reached

58. add an option to not play sound in the cncnet/network/lan lobby, the sound gets played inside MessageListClass::Add_Message(), need to modify it so it doesnt play a sound if a global variable is true and then patch the calls to it inside Net_Join_Dialog() to set the variable, also need to remove calls to the Sound_Effect() function in a few places inside Net_Join_Dialog().

41. Add rules.ini keyword to make ai build nuke silos and service depots, replacing with kennels at:

AUTO:004DA898                 mov     eax, 17h

with mov eax, 1dh 

BaseClass::Is_Built(int) might be a function that can help limiting service depot, nuke silo etc to only one

42. AI doesn't build shock troopers

47. [19:03:39] <iran> i think it's because of the code that blacks the borders of the main menu graphic
[19:03:48] <iran> it works by clearing the background whenever a pcx file is loaded
[19:04:00] <iran> which is done for the credits screen with that file

56. add displaying of messages typed by yourself as an optional redalert.ini setting

52. Make the reject button send out the 'cancel game' packet to a player

49. A few message boxes and in-game things reference "Command & Conquer" instead of "Red Alert".

40. Add a rules.ini keyword to not have the AI sell their structures when all production facilities are destroyed

45. Add extra colour remaps

42. Should make AI build radar dome after WF instead of at start (use the BaseClass::Is_Built(int) if can help)

45. Allies AI seems to sell Tech center, but not dome

41. Probably can add minicampaigns by having the game read a new scenario keyword by checking a call to Map_Selection and replacing it

38. After making AI fixes and adding them as rules.ini keywords, make a rules.ini mod with AI fixes + hard AI plus fast Aftermath build speed
37. sam site fire smoke is misplaced and has C&C95 Nod Sam Site graphics overlayed (this doesn't seem noticable)
42. Create a Red Alert 1 theme pack for windows 7 (using the unfinished one as base)

EDIT: Seems that if you join someones game who has a custom and map it starts transfering and you hit cancel you get "Unable to Read" scenario, hit ok and it goes to desktop, rather than back to the lobby.

[17:49:34] <Chad1233> When you ally a AI
[17:49:43] <Chad1233> does most of his base reveal to you?
[17:49:52] <Chad1233> Because that's soppose to happen
[17:50:00] <Chad1233> To a player
